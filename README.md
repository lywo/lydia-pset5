# Weather app README #

## Description ##
App that gets user input city name and via http request, gets weatherdata from that city.
The weachter API from openweathermap.org is used for data.
Different cities can be stored in a ListView, with information about rain, temperature, clouds and windspeed.
Data is not saved when app is closed, so a new search gives up to date weather information. 
Delete an item via longpress on the item in the ListView.
With just one shortpress on an Item..
